## Creative Expansion Techniques

### 1. What If Scenarios
Present provocative hypothetical situations that challenge assumptions and remove constraints.

**Key Questions:**
- "What if we had unlimited resources?"
- "What if our product could read minds?"
- "What if the rules didn't apply?"
- "What if we solved the opposite problem?"

**Process:**
1. Pose provocative question
2. Explore implications deeply
3. Extract principles from the exploration
4. Apply principles back to real problem

**Best For:** Breaking mental barriers, exploring radical possibilities, paradigm shifts

### 2. Analogical Thinking
Use unrelated analogies to generate fresh perspectives and solutions.

**Key Questions:**
- "How is this problem like [unrelated domain]?"
- "What would [expert from another field] do?"
- "How does nature solve this?"

**Process:**
1. Choose analogy from distant domain
2. Map characteristics and behaviors
3. Find 2-3 more analogies
4. Bridge insights back to original problem

**Best For:** Finding unexpected solutions, lateral thinking, cross-domain innovation

### 3. Reversal/Inversion
Reverse the problem to its opposite, solve that, then invert solutions back.

**Key Questions:**
- "How could we make this worse?"
- "What would guarantee failure?"
- "What's the opposite of our goal?"

**Process:**
1. Define desired outcome clearly
2. Reverse to opposite outcome
3. Generate solutions for reversed problem
4. Invert solutions back to original context

**Best For:** Identifying hidden assumptions, finding counterintuitive solutions

### 4. First Principles Thinking
Break problems down to fundamental truths and reconstruct from basic elements.

**Key Questions:**
- "What do we know to be absolutely true?"
- "Why do we believe this?"
- "What are the physics/economics/psychology here?"

**Process:**
1. Identify all assumptions
2. Challenge each systematically
3. Break down to fundamental truths
4. Reconstruct solutions from basics

**Best For:** Complex problems, challenging industry norms, breakthrough innovation

## Structured Frameworks

### 5. SCAMPER Method
Systematic exploration using seven modification strategies.

- **S**ubstitute: What can be substituted? (materials, resources, approaches)
- **C**ombine: What can be combined? (features, functions, resources)
- **A**dapt: What can be adapted? (from other contexts, industries)
- **M**odify/Magnify: What can be emphasized or minimized?
- **P**ut to other use: What else could this be used for?
- **E**liminate: What can be removed or simplified?
- **R**everse/Rearrange: What can be reordered or flipped?

**Process:** Spend 5-10 minutes on each letter systematically

**Best For:** Product improvement, feature discovery, comprehensive exploration

### 6. Six Thinking Hats
Systematic perspective rotation using different thinking modes.

- **üîµ Blue Hat**: Process control, meeting management, overview
- **‚ö™ White Hat**: Facts, data, information gaps
- **üî¥ Red Hat**: Emotions, hunches, intuition (30 seconds only)
- **‚ö´ Black Hat**: Critical judgment, caution, risks
- **üü° Yellow Hat**: Positive assessment, benefits, optimism
- **üü¢ Green Hat**: Creative ideas, alternatives, possibilities

**Process:** 2-5 minutes per hat with clear transitions

**Best For:** Balanced evaluation, team alignment, decision making

### 7. Mind Mapping
Visual idea networks branching from central concepts.

**Process:**
1. Central theme in middle
2. Primary branches for main categories
3. Sub-branches with details and connections
4. Use colors, symbols, and images

**Structure Types:**
- Hierarchical (top-down organization)
- Categorical (grouped by themes)
- Associative (free-form connections)

**Best For:** Exploring relationships, comprehensive overview, visual thinkers

## Collaborative Techniques

### 8. "Yes, And..." Building
Accept and build upon every idea without judgment.

**Process:**
1. Accept previous idea completely ("Yes")
2. Add something new ("And")
3. Continue cycle rapidly
4. No "but" statements allowed

**Rules:**
- Build genuinely on previous ideas
- Maintain momentum
- Suspend judgment entirely

**Best For:** Rapid ideation, team creativity, positive atmosphere

### 9. Brainwriting/Round Robin
Written idea generation and building in structured rounds.

**Process:**
1. Individual writing (5 minutes)
2. Pass papers to next person
3. Build on received ideas (5 minutes)
4. Repeat 3-4 rounds

**Structure:**
- 4-8 participants ideal
- Clear time limits
- Option for anonymity

**Best For:** Introverted teams, avoiding groupthink, equal participation

### 10. Random Stimulation
Use random stimuli to trigger unexpected connections.

**Process:**
1. Select random word/image/object
2. Generate associations and characteristics
3. Force connections to problem
4. Develop practical ideas from connections

**Sources:** Dictionary, random images, objects in room, websites

**Best For:** Breaking fixation, finding novel connections, refreshing perspective

## Deep Exploration Techniques

### 11. Five Whys
Dig deeper through iterative questioning to reach root causes.

**Process:**
1. State problem clearly
2. Ask "Why does this happen?"
3. For each answer, ask "Why?" again
4. Continue 5+ times until root cause emerges
5. May branch into multiple paths

**Rules:**
- Stay factual
- Avoid blame
- Follow evidence

**Best For:** Problem analysis, understanding motivations, root cause analysis

### 12. Morphological Analysis
Systematic exploration of all possible parameter combinations.

**Process:**
1. Identify 3-7 key parameters
2. List all options for each parameter
3. Create combination matrix
4. Systematically explore combinations
5. Identify promising solutions

**Structure:** Parameters √ó Options = Solution Space

**Best For:** Complex systems, finding unexplored combinations, comprehensive coverage

### 13. Provocation Technique (PO)
Use deliberately unreasonable statements as stepping stones.

**Process:**
1. Make "Po:" statement violating logic
2. Use as mental stepping stone
3. Extract underlying principles
4. Develop practical ideas from principles

**Example:**
- Po: "Cars have square wheels"
- Principle: Variable ground contact
- Practical: Adaptive suspension system

**Best For:** Breakthrough innovation, escaping mental ruts, lateral thinking

## Advanced Techniques

### 14. Forced Relationships
Connect unrelated concepts and explore all possible relationships.

**Process:**

2. List attributes of each
3. Force connections between attributes
4. Generate ideas from connections

**Relationship Types:**
- Functional (how they work together)
- Structural (how they combine)
- Causal (how one affects the other)
- Metaphorical (how they're similar)

**Best For:** Finding unexpected connections, innovation, creative problem solving

### 15. Assumption Reversal
Systematically challenge and reverse all assumptions.

**Process:**

- Expert from another field
- Historical figure
- Fictional character
- Non-human entity

**Process:**
