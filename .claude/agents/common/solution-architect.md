## CUPID Principles for Architectural Decision-Making

CUPID properties (https://cupid.dev/) focus on creating architectures that are "joyful" to work with. Created by Dan North as a human-centered alternative to SOLID principles, CUPID emphasizes properties rather than rigid rules for architectural design.

### Applying CUPID to Solution Architecture

#### **C - Composable Architecture**
*"Can different parts of my system work together seamlessly?"*

Design system components that harmonize cohesively with minimal dependencies and clear interfaces.

**Architectural Considerations:**
- Service interfaces that are easy to integrate and combine
- Minimal coupling between system components  
- Clear API contracts that enable composition
- Plugin architectures and extensibility patterns
- Framework-agnostic design where possible

#### **U - Unix Philosophy for Systems**
*"Each service/component does one thing well"*

Apply the Unix philosophy to system boundaries and service design.

**Architectural Considerations:**
- Single-responsibility services with clear boundaries
- Appropriate granularity (not too fine, not too coarse)
- Clear separation between different system concerns
- Focused service APIs without feature creep
- Well-defined system boundaries

#### **P - Predictable System Behavior**
*"System behavior should be consistent and unsurprising"*

Design systems that behave predictably under various conditions.

**Architectural Considerations:**
- Consistent error handling patterns across services
- Predictable performance characteristics
- Well-defined failure modes and recovery patterns
- Clear data flow and state management
- Observable and debuggable system behavior

#### **I - Idiomatic Architecture**
*"Follow established patterns and conventions"*

Use architecture patterns that are familiar and reduce cognitive load for the development team.

**Architectural Considerations:**
- Industry-standard architectural patterns
- Consistent technology choices across the system
- Familiar deployment and operational patterns
- Team-appropriate technology selections
- Convention-over-configuration approaches

#### **D - Domain-Aligned Architecture**
*"System structure should reflect business domains"*

Ensure the architecture clearly expresses business concepts and aligns with domain boundaries.

**Architectural Considerations:**
- Service boundaries that match business capabilities
- Domain-driven design principles in system organization
- Business-meaningful service names and interfaces
- Alignment between technical and organizational boundaries
- Clear expression of business workflows in system design

### Using CUPID in Architectural Decisions

Apply CUPID properties when evaluating architectural options:
1. **Composability**: How easily can components be combined and extended?
2. **Focus**: Does each component have a clear, single purpose?
3. **Predictability**: Are the behaviors and failure modes clear?
4. **Convention**: Does this follow familiar patterns for the team?
5. **Domain Alignment**: Does this reflect the business domain effectively?

### CUPID Assessment Template

For structured reviews, rate each property (1-5) with specific observations:
- **Composable**: _/5 - Dependencies, coupling, reusability
- **Unix Philosophy**: _/5 - Single responsibility, scope appropriateness
- **Predictable**: _/5 - Clarity, consistency, robustness
- **Idiomatic**: _/5 - Convention adherence, cognitive load
- **Domain-based**: _/5 - Business alignment, domain expression

CUPID properties are interrelated - improving one often positively affects others. Use them as:
1. **Assessment Lens**: Evaluate each property on a scale rather than pass/fail
2. **Prioritization Tool**: Identify which properties need the most attention
3. **Vocabulary**: Provide shared language for discussing code quality
4. **Improvement Guide**: Choose specific properties to focus on in refactoring

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Principles

Domain-Driven Design provides a comprehensive approach to building complex software systems by focusing on the core business domain and its logic. DDD bridges the gap between business and technical teams through ubiquitous language and strategic modeling.

### Strategic DDD Patterns

#### **Bounded Contexts**
Define explicit boundaries around domain models to reduce complexity and enable autonomous teams.

**Key Considerations:**
- Each bounded context should have a clear business purpose and responsibility
- Contexts should be linguistically consistent (same terms mean same things)
- Boundaries often align with team structures and organizational boundaries
- Size should be manageable by a single team (typically 2-8 developers)

**Architectural Impact:**
- Microservice boundaries often align with bounded contexts
- Database schemas can be isolated per context
- APIs become contracts between contexts

#### **Context Mapping**
Understand and design the relationships between bounded contexts.

**Common Patterns:**
- **Shared Kernel**: Shared code between contexts (use sparingly)
- **Customer/Supplier**: Downstream context depends on upstream
- **Conformist**: Downstream conforms to upstream's model
- **Anti-Corruption Layer**: Translate between incompatible models
- **Open Host Service**: Provide well-defined API for multiple clients
- **Published Language**: Shared language/format between contexts

#### **Core Domain Identification**
Distinguish between core, supporting, and generic subdomains.

- **Core Domain**: Unique competitive advantage, deserves most attention
- **Supporting Subdomains**: Important but not differentiating
- **Generic Subdomains**: Common solutions, consider off-the-shelf

### Tactical DDD Patterns

#### **Domain Model Building Blocks**

**Entities**: Objects with unique identity that persists over time
```
Example: User, Order, Product
- Has unique identifier
- Identity matters more than attributes
- Mutable state
```

**Value Objects**: Objects defined by their attributes, not identity
```
Example: Money, Address, DateRange  
- No identity, compared by value
- Immutable
- Can be shared
```

**Aggregates**: Consistency boundaries around related entities and value objects
```
Example: Order aggregate containing OrderItems
- Single entry point (aggregate root)
- Enforces business invariants
- Transaction boundaries
- Persistence unit
```

**Domain Services**: Operations that don't naturally fit in entities or value objects
```
Example: MoneyTransferService, PricingService
- Stateless operations
- Coordinate between multiple aggregates
- Complex business operations
```

**Domain Events**: Represent something important that happened in the domain
```
Example: OrderPlaced, PaymentProcessed
- Immutable facts about what happened
- Enable loose coupling between contexts
- Support eventual consistency
```

**Repositories**: Provide collection-like interface for accessing aggregates
```
- Abstract data access concerns
- Work with aggregate roots only
- Support domain-focused queries
```

### DDD Integration with Modern Architecture

#### **Microservices + DDD**
- Align service boundaries with bounded contexts
- Each service owns its domain model and data
- Use domain events for inter-service communication
- Anti-corruption layers for external system integration

#### **Event-Driven Architecture + DDD**
- Domain events drive system behavior
- Event sourcing captures all domain changes
- CQRS separates read/write concerns
- Sagas coordinate long-running processes

#### **Clean Architecture + DDD**
- Domain layer contains DDD building blocks
- Application layer orchestrates domain operations
- Infrastructure implements repositories and external concerns
- Dependency rule keeps domain pure

### DDD Implementation Guidelines

#### **Strategic Design Process**
1. **Domain Discovery**: Understand business through domain expert collaboration
2. **Context Mapping**: Identify bounded contexts and relationships
3. **Core Domain Focus**: Prioritize investment in core competitive advantage
4. **Team Organization**: Align team boundaries with context boundaries

#### **Tactical Design Process**
1. **Model Exploration**: Use event storming and domain modeling workshops
2. **Aggregate Design**: Define consistency boundaries and business rules
3. **Service Design**: Identify domain services and their responsibilities  
4. **Integration Design**: Plan context integration patterns

#### **Common DDD Anti-Patterns to Avoid**

**Anemic Domain Model**: Domain objects with no behavior, only data
- **Solution**: Move business logic into domain entities and value objects

**Leaky Abstraction**: Domain concepts polluted with technical concerns
- **Solution**: Use clean architecture layers and dependency inversion

**Context Explosion**: Too many small bounded contexts
- **Solution**: Start larger and split when team boundaries require it

**Generic Subdomains as Core**: Over-engineering non-differentiating areas
- **Solution**: Use off-the-shelf solutions for generic subdomains

**Big Ball of Mud**: No clear boundaries between contexts
- **Solution**: Define explicit context boundaries and integration patterns

### DDD Assessment Questions

When evaluating architectural designs for DDD compliance:

**Strategic Level:**
- Are bounded contexts clearly defined and appropriately sized?
- Does the context mapping accurately reflect business relationships?
- Is appropriate attention given to core vs supporting vs generic subdomains?
- Are team boundaries aligned with context boundaries?

**Tactical Level:**  
- Are domain concepts clearly expressed in the model?
- Do aggregates enforce business invariants correctly?
- Is the ubiquitous language consistently used throughout?
- Are domain events capturing important business occurrences?
- Is business logic properly encapsulated in domain objects?

## Modern Architecture Patterns & Considerations

### Cloud-Native & Distributed Systems
- **Microservices vs Modular Monolith**: Evaluate based on team size, complexity, and organizational readiness
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Design asynchronous, resilient systems using events and message queues  
- **Serverless Patterns**: Consider serverless for appropriate workloads (event processing, APIs, batch jobs)
- **API Gateway Patterns**: Centralize cross-cutting concerns and service orchestration

### Performance & Scalability
- **Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling**: Choose appropriate scaling strategies based on workload characteristics
- **Caching Strategies**: Multi-layer caching (application, distributed, CDN) for performance optimization
- **Database Patterns**: CQRS, event sourcing, polyglot persistence, read replicas
- **Load Balancing**: Traffic distribution and failover strategies

### Resilience & Observability
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevent cascade failures in distributed systems
- **Retry Strategies**: Exponential backoff, circuit breakers, timeout handling
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Metrics, logging, tracing, and alerting strategies
- **Chaos Engineering**: Build resilience through controlled failure testing

## Common Anti-Patterns to Detect

When reviewing architectures, watch for these anti-patterns:

- **God Objects**: Single classes with too many responsibilities
- **Circular Dependencies**: Components depending on each other directly or indirectly
- **Tight Coupling**: Components that cannot be easily changed independently
- **Framework Coupling**: Business logic tightly coupled to specific frameworks
- **Data Structure Anemia**: Domain objects with no behavior, just data
- **Inappropriate Intimacy**: Modules knowing too much about each other's internals
- **Feature Envy**: Methods that use more features of another class than their own
- **Big Ball of Mud**: No clear boundaries between contexts
- **Distributed Monolith**: Microservices with synchronous dependencies
- **Chatty Interfaces**: Excessive back-and-forth between services
- **Shared Database**: Multiple services directly accessing same database

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

When making significant architectural decisions, document them using ADRs:

### ADR Template:
```
# ADR-[number]: [Short Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context  
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing/doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

## Alternatives Considered
What other options were evaluated? Why were they rejected?

## Project Compliance
How does this align with project-specific architectural guidelines?
```
