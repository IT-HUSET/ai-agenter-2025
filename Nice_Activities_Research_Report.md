## Part 1: Restaurant Scene in Nice

### Market Overview

Nice boasts one of the French Riviera's most vibrant dining scenes with **2,343 active restaurants** spanning traditional Niçoise cuisine to innovative international fusion.

### Unique Selling Points - Why Nice Restaurants Stand Out

#### 1. **Only Michelin-Starred Vegan Restaurant in France**
**Racines** (Chef Bruno Cirino) earned its Michelin star in 2024, making it the only starred vegan restaurant in the entire country. This is a significant draw for:

#### 3. **Authentic Niçoise Cuisine**
Nice offers exclusive access to **Cuisine Niçoise** - a distinct Mediterranean culinary tradition unavailable elsewhere:
- **Socca**: Chickpea pancake unique to Nice
- **Pan Bagnat**: The original Niçoise sandwich

- 60+ year-old family institutions (Chez Davia)

#### 4. **Exceptional Value Proposition**
Unlike Monaco or Cannes, Nice offers:

- Budget options without sacrificing authenticity

## Appendix A: BBQ Tapir Boat Tours (Requested Research)

### Finding: Does Not Exist

After comprehensive research across multiple angles, **no boat tours anywhere in the world offer BBQ'd tapir meat** as part of their dining experience.

### Key Reasons

**1. Conservation Status**
- All 4 tapir species: Endangered or Vulnerable (IUCN Red List)
- Baird's, Mountain, Malayan Tapirs: ENDANGERED
- Lowland Tapir: VULNERABLE
- Populations decreasing globally

**2. Legal Status**
- **Suriname**: ONLY country allowing tapir hunting (highly restricted, June-August season only)
- **All other tapir habitats**: Hunting illegal or strictly prohibited
- **Commercial sale**: Illegal everywhere, even where subsistence hunting permitted
- **CITES regulations**: International wildlife trade prohibited

**3. Cultural Context**
- Tapir consumption limited to indigenous subsistence hunting
- Many indigenous groups consider tapirs sacred (Waorani, Mayoruna, Campa, Achuar)
- NOT a tourist commodity or commercial food product
- Preparation traditionally in stews/soups, not BBQ

**4. Tourism Industry Reality**
- Legitimate tour operators focus on conservation and wildlife viewing
- Amazon luxury cruises emphasize sustainable, legal ingredients
- BBQ boats worldwide serve conventional meats (beef, pork, chicken, seafood)
- No market demand from ethical tourism segment

### Alternative Options Researched

**Similar Experiences That DO Exist:**
- Alaska Wilderness Crab Feast cruises (legal, sustainable Dungeness crab)
- Amazon river cruises with contemporary Amazonian cuisine (fruits, fish, vegetables)
- Memphis riverboat BBQ cruises (traditional American BBQ meats)
- Amsterdam BBQ boats (international BBQ, conventional meats)

**Recommendation:** If exotic/unique dining on water is the goal, Alaska crab feast cruises offer legal, sustainable, and genuinely unique seafood experiences.
