# Interactive Idea Refinement Process

A conversation-driven approach to refine application concepts through structured discovery interviews, strategic analysis, and targeted creative exploration.


## Input

### Variables
_The initial idea for the application:_
INITIAL_IDEA: $1

_Standard directory for all artifacts created by this command and other commands, as part of the spec process:_
SPEC_DIR: $2 (or defaults to `ai_docs/specs/new-feature/`)

### Input Validation
If the _`INITIAL_IDEA`_ is missing, **STOP** immediately and ask the user to provide it.

## Output
Store the refined idea in a file called _`1-idea-refinement.md`_ in the directory `SPEC_DIR`, i.e.:
```bash
SPEC_DIR/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1-idea-refinement.md
```

**Core Principles:**
- **Listen First, Talk Second**: Let the user guide the conversation
- **Follow the Energy**: Dig deeper where passion appears
- **Embrace Tangents**: Often reveal hidden insights
- **Challenge Respectfully**: Question assumptions constructively
- **Build Together**: Make it collaborative, not interrogative

### 2.2 Interview Structure

#### Opening (5 minutes)
**Set the Tone:**
```
"I'm excited to help refine your idea. Let's have a conversation about what you're
envisioning. I'll ask questions to understand your vision deeply, challenge assumptions
constructively, and explore possibilities together. Ready?"
```

**Start Broad:**
- "Tell me the story of how this idea came to be"
- "Paint me a picture of success - what does that look like?"
- "Who's the hero of this story - your ideal user?"

- "If I had to pitch this in one sentence..."

### 2.3 Advanced Interview Techniques

#### Active Listening Signals
- **Mirroring**: Repeat key phrases to show understanding
- **Summarizing**: "So what you're saying is..."
- **Emotional Labeling**: "It sounds like you're frustrated by..."
- **Silence**: Use 3-5 second pauses to let thoughts develop

#### Question Techniques
